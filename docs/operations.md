# Operations guide

## Runtime topology

The v0.1 topology has one business Ray Job per Redis task:

```text
Redis task Stream
  -> provider consume loop
  -> deterministic RayJobSubmission
  -> provider execution-driver Ray Job
  -> Tributo in-process training or batch-inference API
  -> Bundle or ResultSink
  -> provider event Stream
```

Operation mappings only validate and prepare driver input. They do not call a
training or inference submission API, so inference cannot create a nested Ray
Job.

## Admission and ACK

The consumer validates protocol, outer identity, supported operation/profile,
and queued cancellation before admission. It then submits or reconciles a
deterministic `submission_id`, records the in-memory active mapping, publishes
`ACCEPTED`, and calls `XACK`.

`ACK` means Ray accepted the execution, not that execution completed. An
ambiguous Ray response is queried by the same `submission_id`; if admission
cannot be confirmed, the Redis delivery remains pending. An invalid or
unsupported request publishes a sanitized `FAILED` event and is ACKed to avoid
a poison loop.

The event Stream is best effort. It is not an outbox or terminal ledger.
Failures to publish `PHASE`, `LOG`, `METRICS`, or `PROGRESS` are logged and do
not replace a successful workload result with `EXECUTION_FAILED`. The driver
makes at most one immediate retry for a transient nonterminal publication
failure; this is not a durable delivery guarantee.

New consumer groups start at `0-0`, so tasks already present in a newly
configured Stream are eligible for delivery. `block_ms` must be a positive,
finite timeout; explicit zero-timeout polls are issued without Redis `BLOCK`
and are therefore nonblocking.

## Cancellation

Each operation has an independent cancel key prefix.

- Before admission, an existing cancel key produces `CANCELLED` and ACK; no
  Ray Job is created. A failed cancel-key check is fail-closed and leaves the
  delivery pending.
- After admission, the provider watcher calls `stop_job(submission_id)`. It
  publishes `CANCELLED` only after Ray reports `STOPPED`.
- If Ray already reports `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED`, a later cancel key has no
  effect.
- If Ray reports `STOPPED` without a provider stop request, the watcher removes
  the process-local active entry without publishing `CANCELLED`. Consumers must
  use the accepted `submission_id` to inspect Ray status; v0.1 does not invent a
  provider cancellation reason for an external stop.

The active operation map is process-local. Restart recovery and cooperative
worker cancellation are not v0.1 guarantees.

The watcher checks for an existing terminal event before requesting a stop,
but artifact persistence and event publication are not transactional in v0.1.
If cancellation lands in that narrow interval, consumers must treat a durable
Bundle or ResultSink receipt as the execution fact. Durable terminal
arbitration belongs to the later reliability phase.

## Credentials

Tasks may include only a reference such as `env:OBJECT_STORE_PROFILE` or
`mount:/var/run/secrets/object-store`. The execution driver verifies the
reference inside its pre-provisioned Ray runtime. It does not copy the value
into Ray metadata or request-derived runtime env.

Credential values are also rejected when embedded as URI user information or
sensitive query parameters. Arbitrary opaque values cannot be classified as
secrets generically; integrations must use `credential_ref` rather than
placing credential material in operation configuration maps.
`credential_ref` is accepted only as the direct `spec.credential_ref` field;
nested lookalike fields are rejected.

If execution succeeds but the `COMPLETED` event cannot be encoded or
published, the driver classifies the notification failure as
`TERMINAL_EVENT_PUBLICATION_FAILED`, not as an execution failure. Event
delivery remains best effort.

Redis URLs must be credential-free. Deployments that require authenticated
Redis should add an independently reviewed client/secret integration in a
later provider version; plaintext URL credentials are rejected in v0.1.

## Observability

Use the channel's configured outer identity field (default `operation_id`) to
route task and event entries, and use `submission_id` to query Ray Jobs. Event
JSON retains canonical `operation_id` and includes public protocol identity, event ID,
timestamp, operation/run/attempt identity, optional `ray_job_id`, phase, and a
bounded redacted payload.

Expected training events include `PHASE`, `LOG`, `METRICS`, and a terminal
event. Expected inference events include `PHASE`, `LOG`, `PROGRESS`, and a
terminal event. `COMPLETED` carries a credential-free Bundle or ResultSink
reference.

## Alpha failure boundary

An external supervisor may restart the consume process after a Redis outage.
XAUTOCLAIM remains a best-effort hook, but the release does not promise cursor
persistence, reconnect state restoration, DLQ behavior, HA, durable events,
or cross-restart exactly-once execution.

## Validation

Run configuration validation before starting the service:

```bash
tributo-broker-redis validate --config /etc/tributo/redis-provider.json
tributo-broker-redis validate --config /etc/tributo/redis-provider.json --check-connectivity
```

Configuration validation requires a Core source root usable by Ray runtime
packaging and an explicit provider driver distribution before the consumer
group is opened or any task is read. Compatibility with the Core
`submit_ray_job()` runtime-env extension contract is verified by the pinned
Core baseline, static typing, wheel contract, and Redis/Ray integration matrix.

Start the provider-owned loop under a process supervisor:

```bash
tributo-broker-redis consume --config /etc/tributo/redis-provider.json
```
